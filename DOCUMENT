Action Points

1) PD/LD
On-time borrowers (days_past_due = NaN or 0).
Late payers (1–30 days overdue).
High-risk defaults (>90 days overdue).

2)Portfolio Risk Profile:
% of loans that are overdue.
Average overdue days by country or loan type.
Risk concentration (e.g., “20% of loans are 60+ days overdue”).



3. Potential Red Flags to Watch
High percentage of days_past_due > 30 → signs of portfolio stress.
Loans with no repayments since issuance.
Large concentration of loans in one country with rising overdue rates.
Repeat late payers who still get new loans.
